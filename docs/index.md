# Overview
## A General Purpose Datapack Library

Moxlib is an ever-expanding, extensive utility library aimed on improving the experience for datapack creators.

Moxlib largely follows a standard API pattern, with the exception of a couple specialised functions and modules.

The different functions are grouped into modules, specific to the tasks they perform.

Moxlib is licensed under the GNU LGPL, meaning you are free to use it in your own Datapacks, themselves under any license,
but any changes you make to Moxlib must be released under the terms of the LGPL.
See [LICENSE.md](https://github.com/moxvallix/moxlib/blob/main/LICENSE.md) for full license.
