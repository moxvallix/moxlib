# Getting Started
## Downloading Moxlib
[:material-download: Download Moxlib](https://modrinth.com/datapack/moxlib/versions)  
[:material-download: Download Moxlib Exp](https://modrinth.com/datapack/moxlib-exp/versions) (Optional)

!!! info ":material-flask: Experimental Features"
    Some functions and modules require experimental features, which will cause a
    prompt on loading the world. As such, **Moxlib** makes these features optional, by keeping them in a separate
    datapack, **Moxlib Exp**.

    If a function, or module, is marked with **:material-flask: Experimental**, that means it requires **Moxlib Exp**.

## Installing Moxlib

You can install datapacks by placing their `.zip` files in the `datapacks/` directory of your Minecraft world.

In Single player, you can find the world's folder by pressing `Edit` on your selected world, then `Open World Folder`.

On a server, install them into the `datapacks/` directory of your primary world folder (usually `world/`).
