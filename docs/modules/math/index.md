# Math
## A collection of useful math formulas

Moxlib provides some useful math functions in this module.

Instead of the usual data API, this module largely uses a scoreboard based API.
It is quite similar. The input value will usually be the fake player `$target`.
Output, however, depends on the function.

The objective path follows a similar convention to the data path, but using `.` instead.
Eg. `moxlib:api/math/random` writes to `moxlib.api.math.random`.
